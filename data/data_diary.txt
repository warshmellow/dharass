A Bernoulli Naive Bayes trained on split of a ~450 tweet dataset consisting
of ~150 femfreq's hand classified harassment tweets with ~300 classified by
the development team, and NO cleaning of text, gives the following 
classification report:
(We use train_ and test_02032015.csv)

The cross validated precision, recall, f1-score, and support are as follows:
precision    recall  f1-score   support
1       0.82      0.93      0.87        30
1       0.90      0.87      0.88        30
1       0.73      0.89      0.80        27
1       0.77      0.88      0.82        34
1       0.76      0.94      0.84        31

The test set such scores are:
1       0.76      0.96      0.85        27

This model is the baseline model. It is generated by script

Created F1-Score, Precision, Recall vs Proportion of Positive Class on a
validation set to check sensitivity of above model to class imbalance.
See "exploration 3 march 2015.ipynb" for charts. Suggests that the model is
sensitive up to 5%, in terms of F1-score. After 5%, F1-score increases above
0.5. And we use F1-score because it is unclear whether precision or recall is
more important, so let's weight them equally.
